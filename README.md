## ResumeSite
This website is my resume, graphically represented through hosting with github pages.
Uses Django for the back-end and a combination of HTML5, CSS3, and JS for the front-end.


## Description
This website is meant to be living proof to instatntiate the claims of my resume, displaying that I know how to create original designs using HTML5/CSS3/JS and Bootstrap5. 

## Usage
You are completely free to use any of the code utilized to make this Resume Website, additionally if you like any of the phrasing I utilize, feel free to use it as inspiriation for your own resume. 
I imagine the most interst I would get from the code behind this site would be from the flip cards. They were completely made in CSS3 (retrievable from styles.css under */ flip cards /*), partially using what was inherited from Bootstrap5 cards. If you end up using any aspects of the flip cards, please let me know and privide a link to your usage of them (purely to see what anyone else would use them for). 


## Contributing/Support

If you would like to create a PULL request, please feel free. Whether the intent be to pilfer from the code as you like some elements of the app, or to suggest improvements, you are most welcome to.
